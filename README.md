Project created for the class CMPSC 121 Intro to Programming Techniques during the Spring 2024 semester.

# Inventory Search
The Inventory Search is a C++ program that allows the user to browse through an inventory of parts and add new parts to it. 

## What I learned
- Using vectors, functions and loops in C++.
- Using shell sort and binary search algorithms to sort vectors and search for specific part numbers within a txt file.
